Ruby Assessment Test: LET'S OPEN AN ELECTRONICS STORE!
=============================================================

## Introduction

Welcome to Tech In Business 101!

In this course, we are required to build a system for an electronics store, to keep track of sales, inventory, and sell products to customers. Your assignment is to write the needed code in order to submit the project.

This assessment test has 6 required questions and should be completed in 2 hours. 

There are an additional 3 bonus questions are worth 30% total. Therefore the maximum you can score on this test is 130%.

**Please read this document very carefully before starting.**

## Tips (read in full!)

If you have questions about what tests are expecting, feel free to ask.

The test file names describe what is being10+15+30 implemented.

Run `bundle install` to get started.

Run `bundle exec rspec spec/01_*.rb` to run first test suite. 

**Steps:**

1. Read the CODE for the spec file that you ran.
2. Understand what tests it contains and what each test in that file is expecting.
3. Start implementing your code to satisfy each test.
4. Run the test suite using the same `bundle exec rspec` command, to ensure that you are seeing more and more passing tests.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until all tests pass for that suite.

Once all the tests are passing for that suite, run the next suite.

Example: `bundle exec rspec spec/02_*.rb`

When you are done implementing all the code, you can simply run `bundle exec rspec spec/*` to run all the tests at once, and make sure everything is working as expected.

## Marking

Even if you make all the tests pass, you may lose marks for incorrectly implementing the solution (eg: incorrect use of OOP).

This test is created such that there are indeed correct right ways to implement your app, and incorrect ways.

You can also lose marks for bad form. Some Examples of bad form include:

* Improper or confusing naming of variables, methods, etc.
* Improper indentation
* Overly verbose code that could be implemented much more simply in Ruby
* Not writing code in the "Ruby Way". (Example: using camel casing for variable or method names instead of underscores)

**Note:** Hard coding the behaviour of a method to simply make the current tests pass but not actually fulfilling the goal/responsibility of the method will *not* count as a valid solution, warranting no part marks at all.

## Other Important Notes:

* Do not modify the code in the `spec` folder.
* The tests will require you to create new classes as you progress. These will need to be created in the same folder as `shop.rb`: the `lib` folder.
* You **are allowed** to google around.
* Please do not create a public repo nor share your work in any other way with anyone during the test.
* This test is intended to take 2 hours to complete.
